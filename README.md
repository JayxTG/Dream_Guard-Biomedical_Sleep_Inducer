<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
    Dream Guard is a biomedical sleep inducer designed to improve the quality of sleep for individuals suffering from insomnia. The device uses non-invasive magnetic field technology to promote sleep, offering a safer alternative to medication. The project is developed by a team of four engineering undergraduates from the University of Moratuwa, who have combined their expertise to create a portable, efficient, and user-friendly solution to address sleep disorders.
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    The primary objective of the Dream Guard project is to provide an effective and long-term solution for individuals suffering from insomnia. By leveraging magnetic field technology, the device aims to enhance sleep quality without the side effects associated with conventional treatments like medication. The project also focuses on creating a cost-effective and portable device that can be easily used by anyone, anywhere.
</p>

<h2>Power & Efficiency</h2>
<p>
    Dream Guard is powered by three 3.7V rechargeable batteries, managed by a Battery Management System (BMS) to ensure portability and protection from overcharging. The device includes an LM7805 voltage regulator to maintain a stable 5V output for its components. Efficient power management allows the device to be used reliably over extended periods without frequent recharging.
